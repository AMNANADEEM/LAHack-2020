# LA Hacks-2020
Hello Hackers!

Given the challenging environment we are facing with the coronavirus, the ability to harness DNA data, and matching patient data from various sources is more relevant than ever as health institutions around the world work together.

This year, Office Ally is working on a predictive analysis model to identify diseases the patient may be at risk for, before they occur.  We are asking hackers to help us with 2 challenges:

1. Patient Matching Challenge

2. Google Deepvariant Challenge

These are specific challenges we would like hackers to assist us with - we ask that you solve the problem we present.

Both challenges are equally important - we will hand out prizes based on which teams get the furthest, and also offer creative or unique approaches in solving the problem.

Instructions and files are in each folder of the challenge - please read through them carefully.

Finally, to be eligible, we would like teams to submit us a link  of their code (via github) so we may do additional review.  Each Challenge also has minimum requirements to be eligible.

Thank you and Happy Hacking!
